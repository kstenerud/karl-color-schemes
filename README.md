Karl's Color Schemes
====================

My high-contrast color schemes for Sublime Text 3.

These work well with the [Soda](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme) themes, which can be installed via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io).

Go to **Preferences -> Browse Packages** and copy whichever `xyz.sublime-color-scheme` files you like into the `User` folder.
